🤔 FAQ
Q: Why aren't some commands working?
A: Commands may require specific permissions, or may not be compatible with your game version. Check the console logs for error messages. Most building/spawning commands only work in single-player.
Q: Can I use this on PC?
A: Yes, but it's unnecessary - PC already has a built-in console (accessed with ~ or F1). This mod is specifically designed for mobile players.
Q: Does this work in multiplayer?
A: No, most commands will not work in multiplayer. The mod is designed for single-player use only. Only read-only commands (like checking resources) might work on some servers.
Q: How do I report a bug?
A: Open an issue on GitHub with:
Your device model and OS version
Mindustry version
Steps to reproduce the bug
Console logs (use /export command)
Q: Can I request new features?
A: Yes! Open an issue with the "feature request" label and describe what you'd like to see.
